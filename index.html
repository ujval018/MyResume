        <h2 bold >SUMMARY</h2>
        I am learning and applying different technologies to apply in my professional and academic journey.I am
        consistent and focused towards my goal.
        As a BTech student in Computer Science Engineering at Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, I am passionate about learning and applying the fundamentals of programming, data structures, algorithms, and software engineering. I have a strong interest and skill in C++, which I have demonstrated by earning an advanced certification from Udemy and completing multiple projects using object-oriented principles and concepts.

I am also committed to using my technical knowledge and skills to address social causes and real-world problems. Currently, I am volunteering at Foodation India, a non-profit organization that aims to reduce food waste and hunger in India.
